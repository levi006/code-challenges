select customer.name 
from customer 
  join "order" using (customer_id) 
  join pizza using (pizza_id) 
where order_date >= current_date - interval '30 days' 
group by customer_id 
having sum(quantity * price) >= ALL(
   -- subquery: find total_spent by customers over last 30 days
   select sum(quantity * price)  
   from "order"  
     join pizza using (pizza_id) 
   where order_date >= current_date - interval '30 days' 
   group by customer_id
);

- more complex, a little harder to write
- find all people who have spent in last 30 days >= (all people's spending over last 30 days, by person)


     SELECT customer_id,
        customer.name,
        sum(quantity * price) AS total_orders_cost
       FROM customer
         JOIN "order" USING (customer_id)
         JOIN pizza USING (pizza_id)
      WHERE order_date >= current_date - interval '30 days'
      GROUP BY customer_id
      ORDER BY total_orders_cost DESC
     LIMIT 1;

 - fast, easy to write
 - downside:  you + me both $250
